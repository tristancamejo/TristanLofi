The CD case for Tristan Camejo.

## What's a CD case?
A CD case is a case of cds (albums) which are then full of songs.

## What can I do with this
Use it as a git submodule as a way to use my copyright free beats in your application, for example a Lofi Discord bot.

## What's a ISRC
An ISRC is a unique identifier for a song, you can use it with the Spotify API to get more information such as the album cover here https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#/operations/search

## What's next
A better schema with more features like an album cover property.
